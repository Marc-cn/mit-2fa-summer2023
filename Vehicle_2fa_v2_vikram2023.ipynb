    "### Version 2\n",
    "Summer 2023 \n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Vikram Anantha \\\n",
    "Continued from Ben Dwyer's code \\\n",
    "July 27 2023"

    "## Summary\n",
    "(Same as V1) \\\n",
    "This code is meant to be implemented into Road-Side Systems (RSSs), like traffic cameras, such that it can communicate with vehicles, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to verify their identity."
   ]
  },

   "source": [
    "### Background\n",
    "(Same as V1) \\\n",
    "One problem that might arise when AVs communicate with RSSs is that a hacker with malicious intent can join the same channel and communicate with the RSSs as if they were the vehicle. To combat this, the RSS can command the vehicle to confirm its identity by performing a specific task. Examples of this include:\n",
    " + Displaying a specific pattern on a screen, similar to a QR code\n",
    " + Flashing headlights in a specific pattern\n",
    " + Making a sound in a specific pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vehicle performs the task, the RSS can confirm this has been done visually, thus confirming the identiy of the vehicle. This visual confirmation, a form of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is the premise of this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Version 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an overview of the main simple code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`while loop forever:`\n",
    " - `read in the frame from the ZED camera`\n",
    " - `detect the vehicle in the frame`\n",
    " - `process the frame:`\n",
    "    - `save a cropped version of the frame of just the vehicle`\n",
    "    - `greyscale the cropped image`\n",
    "    - `convert the image to a binary image (any pixel above a brightness is white, any below is black); I call it \"thresholding\" the image`\n",
    "    - `find the Mean Image Brightness (MIB)`\n",
    "    - `high MIBs means brighter image, so the headlight is on, lower means dimmer means headlights off`\n",
    " - `add the on/off state to a list`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes from V1\n",
    "\n",
    "These were the shortcomings from Version 1:\n",
    " 1. When using live feed, there is about a second of delay per frame to detect if a vehicle is present, and to recognize there is no bounding box. It is much more time to recognize the array in the bounding box, which needs to be done for each vehicle.\n",
    " 2. The code runs a for loop to go through each vehicle and detect the pattern, meaning it verifies each vehicle one by one. Because each vehicle takes a long time to be verified, when multiple vehicles are present, the system will take a _very_ long time.\n",
    " 3. When using a webcam, or a dedicated camera for the computer (as in not a smartphone camera, which uses HDR to make screens appear normal with everything else), the Arduino display is super bright, and cannot be recognized. However, this doesn't really matter as much, since in the real environment, having a screen on the windshield won't be implemented. Instead, it would most likely leverage the headlights, having them flash a pattern across time, rather than display a pattern across space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2 solves these problems in these ways:\n",
    " 1. In this Version, the code only detects if there is a vehicle present, so only using 1 model instead of 2. This should cut the latency by about half. In addition, this code has the model on device, meaning it can utilize the extensive hardware to run the model faster. This cuts the latency by half again.\n",
    " 2. This part isn't really fixed, since it still has to go through every vehicle to detect their pattern verification\n",
    " 3. This version does not need a camera with HDR, in fact it actually leverages the HDR-less camera. When the headlights are shining, the camera overexposes them, meaning they will be much brighter than everything else. This makes it much easier to threshold the image and calculate the average brightness."

    "[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) is a platform which houses a vast variety of models, mainly for computer vision. It is often used because it is easy to train the models, and prediction happens over the cloud. For computer vision, Roboflow uses [YOLOv8](https://blog.roboflow.com/whats-new-in-yolov8/) (You Only Look Once), the fastest and most accurate architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboflow has a very intuitive process to upload training images and annotate them. For models that detect (rather than just classify), the model not only must be given the image, but also the coordinates on the image of where the object in question is, and what the object is called. Roboflow allows you to create the training data fairly easily, and can then be downloaded to be trained on device.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Version 1, the training data and the models was stored on RoboFlow, meaning anytime the code required a prediction from the model, it would make a call through the internet. This is ideal for most cases, (i.e. if the user is using a Windows laptop from 1997), however the RSS is meant to be run on an Edge computer, meaning it should have the capabilities to run the model on device. In this version, the model is trained and run on device, making it much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the dataset created in RoboFlow is downloaded onto the device, and a YoloV8 model is trained with this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the dataset is downloaded, it is stored in a folder (for example, `RC-Vehicle-Detection_v2-1`), which has some stuff\n",
    " - `test/`\n",
    "    - `images/`\n",
    "        - folder of the unedited images that were uploaded\n",
    "    - `labels/`\n",
    "        - txt files with the coords of where the object is and its classification\n",
    " - `train/`\n",
    "    - same subfolders as `test`\n",
    " - `valid/`\n",
    "    - same subfolders as `test`\n",
    " - `data.yaml`\n",
    "    - the main datafile, has info about where the images are, what the clssifications are, etc. This file is the only file inputted when training the model \n",
    " - `README`s\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is then trained with this data, and saved."

    "I created the YOLOv8 model and have it predicting on device- the performance is pretty good. When I run it on a simple image, it takes about 0.1 seconds to predict. When I run it on a video, it takes about 0.3 seconds per frame. When I run it on live feed with CV2, it takes about 0.43 seconds of processing. However, when I run the custom detector on the ZED Camera code (which processes both cameras, and tracks the object), it takes about 0.65 seconds to process.

    "I got a video yesterday of how the object detection performs in sunny weather when the model is on device using YoloV8 nano model, and it isn't the worst, however it isn't the best. I found that it works best  when the lighting is consistent (everything in the frame is either sunny or shady); when there is a variety, (half shady half sunny) the camera can't decide whether to make the sunny parts too sunny or the shady parts too shady, so it does some combination of both, which doesn't make the frame that good (since these kinds of webcams don't have High Dynamic Range which most of our phone cameras do). [The video (with the confidence levels) is here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2ZW4CrC4H61wA8sZ6)\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that this accuracy can be fixed simply by making the training data more diverse (since it was largely  just the car in a hallway, a dorm room, and outside but not that sunny), and making sure that the camera taking the photos is also diverse, or is at least the zed camera\n",
    "\n",
    "Something that I thought about while I was on my run this morning is that right now, the code runs like this:\n",
    "while true:\n",
    "   read frame from zed cam\n",
    "   do image recognition on the frame [~0.5 seconds to do]\n",
    "   display the frame\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the frames are being read about once every half second. The way I had envisioned the blinking would be that within a span of 2 seconds, it would have blinked a considerable number of times in different durations to be able to convey a unique code. My concern with this is that since the camera is reading in each frame infrequently, it wouldn't register most of the blinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought of a couple of fixes for this:\n",
    " - We could have each blink last at least half a second, to ensure the edge computer can read each time the display turns off and on. The only issue with this is that the message might take several seconds to convey, which a car wouldn't have if it is moving on the road\n",
    " - We could also try parallel processing, so that the edge computer would read each frame in separately from the processing, meaning the camera will capture every time the car headlights blink. The problem with this is that the computer has to process each of those frames, which would take about 0.5s per frame, so by the time the identity is confirmed the car is long gone\n",
    " - This could also be a problem with the model itself. I noticed that the default model Roboflow comes with has very little latency, so it isn't impossible to reach very fast prediction times, however I assume that they achieved this with a large, diverse, body of training data, and possibly fine tuning the hyperparameters of the model. It is possible to get the training data, but would take a lot of manual work. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have been trying to train the models with different parameters, but I've only been able to train it over night. I'll do a performance review of each of the models to see which one is the fastest and most accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was also thinking, since I now can edit the code on Ben's display, we could try to display a QR code which links to a url hosted on a server (that could submit a POST request), which the edge computer is connected to. I figured this might be good since there should be some optimized models out there to scan QR codes, so it should help with latency, however this still requires the board"

    "In [this paper from Innopolis University in Russia](https://github.com/TechToker/Vehicle-rear-lights-analyser/blob/master/FinalReport.pdf), researchers intended detect if the car in front of them were braking or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers use YOLOv4 to detect whether a car is present for each frame, and then cropp the frame to just the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect the presense of brakelights, they convert each image into YCrCb space, then removes all pixels that aren't pure red. They utilize the fact that the taillights are symmetrical in cars to weed away noise from other cars. They then apply a bounding box over the taillights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if the car is braking, it determines the brightness in the bounding boxes. It's important to note that it has to see what the car looks like when braking vs not braking to know which is brighter, and thus be able to distinguish when it's braking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm can utilize soemthing similar, but will have to identify the headlights a different way since headlights aren't red. Potentially, a ML model could be used to determine the headlights' position. Determining when its on vs off would be the same as the Innopolis paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[This article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6761567) talks about how the researchers detected headlights to track vehicles. They first converted the image to a binary image (meaning grayscaled, then converted everything above a certain threshold to 255 and below that threshold to 0), and detected the blobs. The then detected the blobs of white areas, and considered each blob a candidate for one of the pair of headlights. Finally, they used the property that headlights are symmetrical to pair 2 of the blobs and determine if they are symmetrical (using some equations).\n",
    "From this, they applied it to counting and tracking vehicles in night time / low light. It remains to be seen whether this technique would work in the daytime (since converting the image to binary might not work as well / produce more blobs in higher light), but a method like this could work on the prototype car (since it has the red display board)."

    "    - You could do this on the normal cropped image, a greyscaled version, or a thresholded version\n",
    "    - This has problems in that it might be influenced by other factors, like shade, or the vehicle moving\n",
    "    - For my testing, it does work, however I set the threshold to 200. When the headlights blinked, the mean image value was 11, and otherwise it was 0.5\n",
    " - Take the difference of 2 consecutive full frames ([explained here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8877228/opencv-detect-blinking-lights)) to detect when the light blinks\n",
    "    - This should only be done with thresholded images (otherwise it causes seizures)\n",
    "    - This won't work because the vehicle moves so it will capture the difference between the vehicle's last positions, not the headlights, [as shown here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CMKZ16492xYHcSuj6)\n",
    " - Take the difference of 2 consecutive _cropped_ frames to detect when the light blinks\n",
    "    - This won't work because the cropped frames have very slightly different dimensions, and it would be hard to align them as it would get the vehicle change, not the headlights\n",
    "\n",
    "I did the first option because it's the only one that can actually work. I did this by detecting the vehicle, cropping the vehicle to just that, converting the cropped image to only black or white (I call it thresholding the image, [here is a video where I try a bunch of different thresholds](https://photos.app.goo.gl/YyxE9YHTYNSLU2sCA)), and finding the average light value of the cropped image."
