    "# Vehicle Detection & Confirmation System\n",
    "## Version 2\n",
    "Summer 2023 \n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Vikram Anantha \\\n",
    "Continued from Ben Dwyer's code \\\n",
    "July 27 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "(Same as V1) \\\n",
    "This code is meant to be implemented into Road-Side Systems (RSSs), like traffic cameras, such that it can communicate with vehicles, especially Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "(Same as V1) \\\n",
    "One problem that might arise when AVs communicate with RSSs is that a hacker with malicious intent can join the same channel and communicate with the RSSs as if they were the vehicle. To combat this, the RSS can command the vehicle to confirm its identity by performing a specific task. Examples of this include:\n",
    " + Displaying a specific pattern on a screen, like a QR code\n",
    " + Flashing headlights in a specific pattern\n",
    " + Making a sound in a specific pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vehicle performs the task, the RSS can confirm this has been done visually, thus confirming the identiy of the vehicle. This visual confirmation, a form of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is the premise of this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes from V1\n",
    "\n",
    "These were the shortcomings from Version 1:\n",
    " + When using live feed, there is about a second of delay per frame to detect if a vehicle is present, and to recognize there is no bounding box. It is much more time to recognize the array in the bounding box, which needs to be done for each vehicle.\n",
    " + The code runs a for loop to go through each vehicle and detect the pattern, meaning it verifies each vehicle one by one. Because each vehicle takes a long time to be verified, when multiple vehicles are present, the system will take a _very_ long time.\n",
    " + When using a webcam, or a dedicated camera for the computer (as in not a smartphone camera, which uses HDR to make screens appear normal with everything else), the Arduino display is super bright, and cannot be recognized.\n",
    " + The last point also doesn't really matter as much, since in the real environment, having a screen on the windshield won't be implemented. Instead, it would most likely leverage the headlights, having them flash a pattern across time, rather than display a pattern across space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2 solves these problems in these ways:\n",
    " + (nothing yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Todo (Jul 27 2023):\n",
    " + implement Zed camera based object detection\n",
    " + run a model to use headlights as the pattern recognition\n",
    "    + first get that to run on a given video\n",
    "    + then write arduino code to make the display act like headlights\n",
    "    + then get it to work in real time\n",
    "    + then see if the pattern recognition is needed with ML or just if statements\n",
    " + try to get multiple vehicles to work fast (idk how yet)\n",
    "    + zed api?\n",
    " + Priority 1: documentation"

    "## About RoboFlow and Yolo\n",
    "\n",
    "[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) is a platform which houses a vast variety of models, mainly for computer vision. It is often used because it is easy to train the models, and prediction happens over the cloud. For computer vision, Roboflow uses [YOLOv8](https://blog.roboflow.com/whats-new-in-yolov8/) (You Only Look Once), the fastest and most accurate architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboflow has a very intuitive process to upload training images and annotate them. For models that detect (rather than just classify), the model not only must be given the image, but also the coordinates on the image of where the object in question is, and what the object is called. Roboflow allows you to create the training data fairly easily, and can then be downloaded to be trained on device.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Version 1, the training data and the models was stored on RoboFlow, meaning anytime the code required a prediction from the model, it would make a call through the internet. This is ideal for most cases, (i.e. if the user is using a Windows laptop from 1997), however this code is meant to be run on an Edge computer, meaning it should have the capabilities to run the model on device. In this version, the model is trained and run on device.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the dataset created in RoboFlow is downloaded onto the device, and a YoloV8 model is trained with this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the dataset is downloaded, it is stored in a folder (for example, `RC-Vehicle-Detection_v2-1`), which has a couple files\n",
    " - `test`\n",
    "    - `images`\n",
    "        - folder of the unedited images that were uploaded\n",
    "    - `labels`\n",
    "        - txt files with the coords of where the object is and its classification\n",
    " - `train`\n",
    "    - same subfolders as `test`\n",
    " - `valid`\n",
    "    - same subfolders as `test`\n",
    " - `data.yaml`\n",
    "    - the main datafile, has info about where the images are, what the clssifications are, etc. This file is the only file inputted when training the model \n",
    " - `README`s\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is then trained with this data, and saved."

    "## For Detecting the Headlights\n",
    "In [this paper from Innopolis University in Russia](https://github.com/TechToker/Vehicle-rear-lights-analyser/blob/master/FinalReport.pdf), researchers intended detect if the car in front of them were braking or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers use YOLOv4 to detect whether a car is present for each frame, and then cropp the frame to just the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect the presense of brakelights, they convert each image into YCrCb space, then removes all pixels that aren't pure red. They utilize the fact that the taillights are symmetrical in cars to weed away noise from other cars. They then apply a bounding box over the taillights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if the car is braking, it determines the brightness in the bounding boxes. It's important to note that it has to see what the car looks like when braking vs not braking to know which is brighter, and thus be able to distinguish when it's braking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm can utilize soemthing similar, but will have to identify the headlights a different way since headlights aren't red. Potentially, a ML model could be used to determine the headlights' position. Determining when its on vs off would be the same as the Innopolis paper."
