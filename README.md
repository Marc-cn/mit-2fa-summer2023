Vikram Anantha's Summer 2023 Internship Project with MIT about Vehicle 2 Factor Authentication

This repo has all of the code that I have written for this internship.

Codes for the Car display are in the `DisplayCodes` folder.

The code that I have written (and fully annotated) is the `Vehicle_2fa_v2_vikram2023.ipynb` file.

Email me at [24anantha2@lexingtonma.org](mailto:24anantha2@lexingtonma.org) with any questions.
